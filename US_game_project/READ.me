**Project Description: US States Discovery Game**

**Overview:**
This Python project is an educational game designed to help users learn and remember the 50 states of the United States. The game provides an interactive way to test your knowledge of the US states and allows you to exit the game at any time by typing "exit." Additionally, if you're unable to correctly identify a state, the game records the unidentified states in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file for your review and learning.

**How to Play:**
1. The game randomly selects a US state for you to identify.
2. You type the name of the state you think is correct.
3. If you guess correctly, the state is marked as found, and the game continues.
4. If you're unsure of a state's name, you can type "exit" to leave the game.
5. Any states you couldn't identify are automatically recorded in a CSV file.

**Game Completion:**
The game ends when you successfully identify all 50 US states, or you choose to exit by typing "exit."

**Learning and Tracking:**
This project is not only a fun game but also a learning tool. Any states you couldn't identify during the game are saved to a CSV file named "unidentified_states.csv." You can later review this file to focus on the states you found challenging, helping you improve your knowledge of US geography.

**Python Libraries Used:**
- Turtle 
- Pandas: For managing data and saving unidentified states to a CSV file.
