- View a list of all prisoners currently in the system, along with their respective sentences.
- Search for specific prisoners based on various criteria, such as name, ID number, or offense type.
- Update prisoner information, including sentence status and release dates.
- Generate reports on prisoner statistics, offense types, and sentence durations.
- Secure login system with admin privileges to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x: The application is built using Python, and therefore, Python 3.x or later is required to run it.
- Tkinter: The GUI is developed using Tkinter, which is included in the standard library of Python.
- Other Python modules: Certain additional Python modules may be required based on specific functionalities (e.g., SQLite for database management).
